# Worldsmith Studio

## Description

Worldsmith Studio works with the [worldsmith](https://pub.dev/packages/worldsmith) Dart package, and its command line utility to allow the creation of roleplaying games with little or no code.

You can use it to make RPG's in a friendly graphical user interface, with 0 code. Once you have made your not-so-basic world, you can modify the generated pure dart file to include whatever code you want, thus giving you the best of both worlds.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a new world from the main menu. You can either click on the "New World" icon, or press Control + N. If you have an existing world, this can be opened with the Control + O shortcut, or by clicking the appropriate icon.
